# Programming Projects
I have developed both small and large scale projects using Java language on Eclipse for my courses, incorporating technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Some of the projects I have worked on include building web applications for to-do lists, atm machines, etc.

I have also gained experience in web development technologies such as PHP and MySQL. One of my recent projects involved building a booklist website for students to buy textbooks for their classes.

This project required me to design and implement a database to store information about textbooks, including their titles, authors, editions, and prices. I used PHP to develop the front-end of the website, which allowed users to search for textbooks and add them to their cart for purchase. The back-end of the website was powered by MySQL, which allowed for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Through this project, I gained experience in designing databases, creating web forms using PHP, and integrating data between the front-end and back-end of the website. I also learned about the importance of user interface design and the need to make websites intuitive and easy to use.

Overall, I am constantly seeking out new programming challenges and opportunities to build my skills. If you have any questions or inquiries about my work, please feel free to reach out to me on Discord at Batlez#3740. I would be happy to discuss programming projects and offer any assistance I can.
